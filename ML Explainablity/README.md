# ML Explainability – Kaggle Course Practice

A comprehensive project demonstrating machine learning explainability techniques based on Kaggle's "Machine Learning Explainability" course.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores various techniques for interpreting and explaining machine learning models, focusing on making complex models more transparent and understandable. The implementation uses Python with popular ML libraries to demonstrate key explainability concepts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms and utilities
- **eli5** - Explainability and interpretation library
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebook environment

## 📊 Datasets

The project uses local CSV datasets for demonstration:
- `train.csv` - Primary training dataset
- `train1.csv` - Secondary training dataset  
- `FIFA_2018_Statistics.csv` - FIFA 2018 statistics for feature engineering examples

All datasets are stored in the `/data` directory and are sourced from Kaggle's ML Explainability course materials.

## 🎯 Explainability Techniques Covered

### Permutation Importance
- Understanding feature importance through permutation
- Identifying most influential features in model predictions

### Feature Engineering for Interpretability
- Creating features that enhance model interpretability
- Transforming complex features into more understandable forms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "ML Explainablity"
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory
2. Open `01_data_loading_and_cleaning.ipynb` to begin
3. Follow the notebooks in numerical order for structured learning
